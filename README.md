# Motovation
The date is Sun 5 may I was readng the pragmatic programmer book and they had a section in the first chapter called Your Knowledge Portfolio. There the author had given some tips to be compotenet and grow as a developer. One of the tip ws to learn a new language each year. I had already leraned go and used for some of my projects but I had to catch up to the previous year that in which I didnt learn anything, So I decided why not learn ruby alownwith it as well. I wanted to make a blogging website since a long time and this was the perfect trigger for it.

# Why Ruby
I have seen a lot of good comments about ruby on social forums. It is always mentioned as this batteries included framework that handles everything for you all you have to do is write buisness logic. I was very fascinated by this since I am from the node and golang community where you had to DIY everything yourself. There were other frameworks as well like laravel but honetly I have done php and I dont feel like learning a new framework in it I find php boring for some reason. maybe because its the steps to run or my first language I learned was php I dont have the love for it. I had other choices as well like elixr which is in erlang but I am planning to learn it next year. Also DHH played a huge role in my decision making is an inspiration to me so I would like to use his convention or way of programming to make this

# How I plan to make this
I will first go through the [rails doc](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/) and implement the blog application on their [getting started guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html). Once this is done I will implement my own app but lets see. I am thinking of recording my thoughts here each day as I make my progress but who knows I may or may not who cares anyway.
